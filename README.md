Cooper is a graphical browser for the [Gemini protocol](https://gemini.circumlunar.space), a new lightweight text-only internet protocol.

This is a fork of [Twin Peaks](https://github.com/InvisibleUp/twinpeaks) Gemini browser.

For the foreseeable future, Cooper only runs on Windows. It requires .NET Framework 4.8 or higher, which comes with all modern versions of Windows.

Do keep in mind that this project is still very young, so don't expect everything to work perfectly.
In particular, there isn't yet support for images, search pages, or client certificates.
